                Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff - the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet - but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundereds of miles apart.

                Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is one percent better or one percent worse seems insignificant in the momemnt, <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.</em>

                Success is the product of daily habits - not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. It doesn't matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">What matters is whether your current habits are putting you on the path toward success.</em>
